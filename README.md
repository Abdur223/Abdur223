Hi, Im @Abdur223, I'm a high school student that aims to work in the Cyber Security field. 
I like network hacking, and looking at bugs to exploit or exploit things using rootkits & viruses.
I work on improving my skills on the fundementals of Ethical hacking. 
Sometimes I will be posting some of the projects of mine for people to give feed back on, and to possibly use!
